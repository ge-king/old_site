## What is it?

weatherHub is a HTML5 coding experiment. The goal is to build a fully-fledged weather forecast page. WeatherHub takes data from the `openweathermap` API. 

## How do I use it?

Download the project with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ge-king/weatherHub.git
```

Go to https://openweathermap.com, and set up an API key for yourself. Place the API key in the `weatherHub.html` file, change the location to any location you want, and run in your favourite browser.




## To-do

Future updates will bring:
- Ability to change location from website.
- Forecast, past weather lookup.
- UI improvements.
