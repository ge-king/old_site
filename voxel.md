## What is it?

A simple voxel engine that I am building, to learn C++.

## How do I use it?

If you really want to (it's really not worth it!), download via:

```
git clone https://github.com/ge-king/voxelengine.git
```

Compile the file and run.



## To-do

Future updates will bring:
- Lots, lots more.
