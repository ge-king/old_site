Listed below are various Python projects that can be found on my GitHub, but didn't make it to the main projects page. Be warned - some of these projects are old and not very efficiently/nicely written! Most of them were actually written as practise when I was learning the language. In no particular order:

- [AsymmetricCypherPy](https://github.com/ge-king/AsymmetricCypherPy)
- [macaulay-plotter-py](https://github.com/ge-king/macaulay-plotter-py)
- [diceroll](https://github.com/ge-king/diceroll)
- [simpleZellerpy](https://github.com/ge-king/simpleZellerpy)
