## What is it?

Project Orbital is the name of a planned fully-fledged orbit simulation tool, made in Python3. I currently have some ideas mapped out in `MATLAB`, which I am in the process of translating into `python`.

## How do I use it?

Download the project with:

```
git clone https://github.com/ge-king/ProjectOrbital.git
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the project, use the following command:

```
python ProjectOrbital.py
```

It doesn't do much at the minute!



## To-do

Future updates will bring:
- Everything!
