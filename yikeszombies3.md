The third installment in the YZR game series. The first two games were developed in [Monkey X](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey/tree/develop), by my father [Tom](http://silentshark.co.uk/). 

It's time for YZR3! This game is currently being written in the awesome open-source [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

You can play a HTML5 version of the game (may not be the most current version) [here].
