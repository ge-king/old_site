## About LaTeX

LaTeX (Lah-tek) is a document writing/production software (think Microsoft Word but far more powerful). It produces high-quality typesetting, without the user having to worry about laying their document out too much but instead to concentrate on the **content** of the document. If you read a scientific paper or report, chances are it's written in LaTeX. 

When writing large or complicated documents with lots of figures and equations, LaTeX truly shines - Microsoft Word is extrememly finnicky with layout of figures and equations, and slows down to a crawl when documents get large. I like using this image (stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/uw77th/graph_that_illustrates_why_latex_is_worth_knowing/)) to explain what I mean (as it happens, this graph is actually generated in LaTeX, using TikZ!)

## My set up

I use the online, collaborative editor [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write my documents - I can use it on any computer, and all my files are automatically saved and synced to my account.
